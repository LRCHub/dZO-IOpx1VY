Since dawn of time the fate of men is that of lice,
Equal as parasites and moving without eyes.
A day of reckoning when men exist to burn
Countdown together now and say the words that you heard

Crest falling, kings and queens comforting in their faith,
Unbeknownst to them is the presence of the wraith
Since fate of men is equal to the fate of lice,
As new dawn rises you shall recognize now, the overlord of flies

Hell Satan, Archangelo
Hell Satan, welcome Year Zero
Hell Satan

He will travel the nations
Kingdoms to fall one by one
Victim to fall for temptations,
A daughter to fall for a son.
The ancient serpent deceiver,
The masses standing in awe
He will ascend to the heavens
Above the stars of god

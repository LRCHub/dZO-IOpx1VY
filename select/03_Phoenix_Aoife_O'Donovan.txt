Time's not the villain coming up behind you is a marigold sun
Love if you're willing take a little more time

I smell fire it's coming from the flames that are dancing on my wings
I'm a bird on a wire killing time

Fever's got me shaking it rises up like a road to meet me
Fever's got me quaking like san andreas fault

Just put a cloth to my brow i'll soar like a phoenix from the ashes
Put a pretty blanket down i'm ready now

Looking for forgiveness looking in every cupboard in every room
I'm bearing witness to the passing time

But the clock is ticking like an old man
Singing at the top of his lungs
And the light is flickering we're running out

Fever's got me shaking it rises up like a road to meet me
Fever's got me quaking like san andreas fault

Just put a cloth to my brow i'll soar like a phoenix from the ashes
Put a pretty blanket down i'm ready now

Everybody's looking for somebody to blame
The stages of sadness how many can you name
I stopped at anger, never felt the same

They say it'll fade my scars my tears will dry
And i'll lie under the stars again
Not wondering where you are

Fever's got me shaking it rises up like a road to meet me
Fever's got me quaking like san andreas fault

Just put a cloth to my brow i'll soar like a phoenix from the ashes
Put a pretty blanket down i'm ready now
